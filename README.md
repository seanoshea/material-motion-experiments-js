# Material Motion for JavaScript #

This is an experimental implementation of the concepts outlined in the [Material
Motion Starmap](https://material-motion.gitbooks.io/material-motion-starmap/content/).

### High-level Goals ###

- To enable the motions and gestures [proposed in the Material
  Spec](https://material.google.com/motion/material-motion.html) to be easily
  implemented by application authors in the JS ecosystem.

- To make prototyping new animated experiences simpler.

- To allow authors to write views in terms of URLs, and have the system guide
  the transitions between them.

- To yield a system that feels robust by default.  Fragile transitions erode
  user trust in the overall system: “should I enter my password in a glitchy
  app?”
